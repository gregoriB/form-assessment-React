## Form Coding Assessment

#### Uses React. Just a simple form to dynamically render fields from a JSON file.

Improvements I would add for a real-world application:

-   Custom validation with animations and nice colors. Currently it only uses the browser form validation.
-   Transition animation for the "parental consent" checkbox and any other togglable fields.
-   A spinner and modal for form submission confirmation.
